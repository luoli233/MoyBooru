# WHY
Since long ago I have been wanted to set up an imagebooru.

I have tried Danbooru, but I failed to set it up again and again, on no matter what flatform.

I have tried Gelbooru. Its vesion 0.2.x (now in use) is great but unfortunately closed source.

I have tried other programs but I like none of them...

So I decided to modify the open source Gelbooru 0.1.11 which is not very perfect to get a good one. In my opinion it's a good templet.

# BUT...
As a high school student in PRC, I may not have much time to work on my projects.

And my programming skills may be bad. So sad.

So... I can only update it once in a very while.
